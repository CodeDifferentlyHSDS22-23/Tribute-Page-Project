3. Feature the Subject's Picture: Include a high-quality picture of your role model as the centerpiece of the tribute page. Pay attention to proper positioning techniques to ensure it looks aesthetically pleasing. Consider using CSS properties like margin, padding, and positioning to achieve the desired layout. 

  

4. Complement with Background Colors: Choose background colors that enhance the overall look and feel of the tribute page. Experiment with different color palettes to find the perfect combination that complements the subject's picture and conveys the right mood.
